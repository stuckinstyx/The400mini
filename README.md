Shell scripts to extract rom, atr, and cas game images from the snn/snp files inside the resources.bod file found on The400 mini.  
Use binwalk -e to extract the contents of resources.bod, then use these scripts.

Wavy Navy, Capture the Flag, and Bristles require a second use of binwalk using the options -e -V

Use at your own risk.
